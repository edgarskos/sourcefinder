# sourcefinder script - 
# 1. takes a list of WD items known to have a given source (eg ODNB)
# 2. generates a list of all enWP article matches
# 3. looks to see if each of those matches has an appropriate link/template somewhere
# 4. if not, bing! puts it on a list
# 5. takes list from 4. and generates a pretty citation for it.

# step 0, initialise

# this should be run from within the /scripts directory

# cd ~/scripts # comment out for testing
mkdir -p working
rm working/*

# step 1

curl "http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/beacon.php?prop=1415&source=0" | sed 's/||/\t/g' | grep -v "#" | grep -v ^$ > working/beacon-odnb

# this is going to be a lot to test with, though, so let's just create a local dummy version
