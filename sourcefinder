# sourcefinder script - 
# 1. takes a list of WD items known to have a given source (eg ODNB)
# 2. generates a list of all enWP article matches
# 3. looks to see if each of those matches has an appropriate link/template somewhere
# 4. if not, bing! puts it on a list
# 5. takes list from 4. and generates a pretty citation for it.

# step 0, initialise

# this should be run from within the /scripts directory
